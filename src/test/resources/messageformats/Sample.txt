The Commission, an independent and bi-partisan federal government body, called the Bill’s passage “deeply troubling” .

“The CAB enshrines a pathway to citizenship for immigrants that specifically excludes Muslims,
setting a legal criterion for citizenship based on religion. The CAB is a dangerous turn in the wrong direction;
it runs counter to India’s rich history of secular pluralism and the Indian Constitution, which guarantees
equality before the law regardless of faith,” it said.

“In conjunction with the ongoing National Register of Citizens (NRC) process in Assam and nationwide NRC that
the Home Minister seeks to propose, USCIRF fears that the Indian government is creating a religious test for
Indian citizenship that would strip citizenship from millions of Muslims,” it said.
